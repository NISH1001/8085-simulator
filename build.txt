1) first thing's first : install java development kit as :
	sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

	hit javac in terminal to be sure 

2) now we'll be using 'ant' as our building tool instead of 'make' as makes are lyang with java :
	sudo apt-get install ant

	hit ant in terminal to be sure

3) now 'ant' searches of 'build.xml' in the current directory : so hit following command for test : 
	
	ant compile
	ant jar
	ant run

	or 

	ant compile jar run

	or

	ant clean   --> for cleaning

4) rip java
